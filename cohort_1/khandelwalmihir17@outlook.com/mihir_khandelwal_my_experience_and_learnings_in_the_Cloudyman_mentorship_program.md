- Forecasting:- It is a process of predicting the future based on past and present data. For example, How many passengers we can expect in a given flight?
- Predictive Modelling:- It is used to perform prediction more granular like "Who are the customers who are likely to buy a product in next month?" and then act accordingly.
Machine Leraning:- It is a method of teaching machines to learn things and improve predictions/behaviour based on data on their own. For example, Amazon recommendation system.
